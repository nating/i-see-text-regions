## Human Factors

Presentations 5th, 8th and 11th of December

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Ability to produce high fidelity prototypes based on a task model and task analysis
* Understand the difference in process, analysis and outcome between low and high fidelity prototypes
* Ability to critique a design based on a prototype
* Ability to document and explain the design rationale behind a prototype

The assignment is to produce

**High fidelity prototypes for the application designed in the first assignment.**

**A Presentation of the high fidelity prototypes.**
There will be a five minute presentation on the design where students will walk through user scenarios, in which the rationale will be explained.  
Students will have to fill in short evaluations of the other teams on days that they are not presenting. This will count towards their mark, but not the marks of the presenting teams.

**A Report detailing the analysis, design activities, and rationale for the design.**

Due 14th of December at 4PM Hardcopy

Detailing:
* "Your" analysis
* Design activities
* Rationale for your design
* "In particular" discuss the reasons for any revisions you made to your original paper prototypes "(i.e. present a critique of the prototype)"

The report should be a maximum of four pages, not counting table of contents or screenshots.

Individual contributions must fit together to be coherent within the context of the report

"Besides the group sections in the report, the integration of report components and the overall coherence of the report are the main factors in gaining a good group mark."

50% of the marks will be allocated to the group part of the report and 50% to the individual sections.

Report should contain:
* Brief description of the process through which the high fidelity prototypes were produced
* An analysis and critique of your original paper prototypes
* Design rationale for the high fidelity prototypes
* Presentation of the high fidelity prototypes
* Final analysis of your design
